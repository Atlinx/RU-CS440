        - training_data_percent `f64` -> Percent of training data to use for training
          - **Ex.** 94.5 = 94.5%
        - intermediate layers `String` -> Layers in neural network
          - String of `u64` separate by spaces
            - Each `u64` represents number of nodes (neurons) in a given layer
